</p>
        <p><span class="firstcharacter">O</span>n a Saturday afternoon in mid-April teenage girls ages 13 to 19 got ready for a soccer match on Randall’s Island. While waiting for the girls to put on their blue South Bronx United jerseys and put their hair it, it was hard not to notice the panoramic view from the soccer field, which sat on the edge of the East River. A clear blue sky and picturesque horizon framed by the Robert F. Kennedy Bridge.</p>

        <p>The referee’s whistle brought everyone’s attention back to the soccer field. The game had started. Up and down the field the girls communicated in  English with some sporadic phrases in Spanish: “tranquila”, “juega con paciencia”, “este juego es tuyo”.</p>

        <p>Among South Bronx United players, number 22 stood out on the field. Matilda Kocaj, who’s a tall, pale, long haired brunette, had precise control of the ball. She set up the perfect play for player number 10, who scored the winning goal for the South Bronx United team.</p>
    
        <p>Between the excitement of the game and the shouts in spanglish, it was hard to imagine that Matilda Kocaj’s strength goes beyond her athleticism on the field.</p>

        <p>“Coming here for me, for my brother, it was a life or death situation because anything can happen in that journey,” said Kocaj, an 18-year-old immigrant who left her home in Albania, located in Eastern Europe, three years ago to cross the U.S.-Mexico border alongside her brother.</p>

        <img src="assets/fotos/huddle-2.jpg" alt="SBU Soccer Team" class="image-body">

        <p>Kocaj and her 16-year-old brother are two of the 68,541 minors who completed the dangerous journey across the southern border unaccompanied by a parent or adult during the widely reported influx of unaccompanied minors in 2014, according to Customs and Border Protection.</p>

        <p>“At the Mexican border, I had to cross a river. And then, the police came, and you have to hand yourself in. The police and the people that came were all good. But when I was in the jail, it was horrible,” Kocaj recalled.</p> 

        <P>“I cried. I cried for days because, my brother and I got separated because he’s a boy and I’m a girl. So, I would go to the door and try to see if he was okay and they would just like push me back inside.”</P>
         
        <p>Kocaj paused for a few minutes to wipe her tears while she recounted her journey in a school hallway at Careers In Sports High School in The Bronx, where she participates in the after school programs offered by South Bronx United, a nonprofit organization that provides immigrant families with legal services and youth programs.</p>

<!--         <p>“Tu simplemente no tienes ni la menor idea de lo que te va a pasar allí”, enfatizó Kocaj, sobre su experiencia en el centro de detención fronterizo.</p>
 -->
        <p>It is estimated that from 2013-2016, somewhere between 38,000 and 59,000 unaccompanied minors crossed the border annually. However, 2014 was a exception to the trend with a 55 percent increase in arrivals, as reported by Customs and Borders Protection.  </p>

        <p>Three years have passed since the Kocaj siblings’ arrival, but their battle with the immigration system continues.</p>

         <blockquote class="quote-1"> 
        “More than 66,000 cases pending in the New York court system," said Ziesmer.</blockquote>

<!--         <p>“Yo soy una inmigrante, y no tengo documentos. El proceso de obtener documentos es súper estresante. Puede ser fastidioso y llega un punto en el que comienzas a pensar, ‘de verdad yo me merezco este trato’?”, dijo Kocaj.</p>
 -->
        <p>Kocaj isn’t alone in her situation. Like her, thousands of other minors that crossed the border in 2014 are waiting for a hearing in front of an immigration judge with the hopes of normalizing their immigration status and remain in their new home in the U.S. </p>

<!--         <p>“Ahora mismo hay más de 66.000 casos pendientes en las cortes de inmigración de Nueva York. Y a cada una de esas personas se les da una hora y media para presentar su caso ante un juez,” dijo Jodi Ziesmer, una abogada que trabaja para Catholic Charities en representación de menores no acompañados ante las cortes neoyorquinas.</p>

        <p>The Kocaj siblings arrived at the border with the hopes of being reunited in New York City with their parents, who had left Albania some months earlier. Despite having relatives in the country, these minors will still be considered unaccompanied asylum-seekers, as is the official policy. But that doesn’t mean the process is any easier for them or their families. </p>

        <p>Child migrants who have a relative or sponsor who can act as their legal guardian have a much better chance of winning their case and obtaining a permanent immigration status.  On the other hand, children who have no sponsor have virtually no chance of winning their immigration case and may find themselves deported, according to Ziesmer. 
</p>

<!--         <p>“De estos niños, como 99% de ellos son liberados a familiares o miembros de su comunidad que no tienen ninguna conexión con el sistema de cuidado de crianza, no son pagados por el estado, no se les da ningún tipo de formación y no se les da ningún apoyo o recurso para ayudar a estos niños,” dijo Ziesmer.</p>
 -->

        <p>Each immigration case is individually reviewed to determine if the person demonstrates sufficient evidence to warrant permission to remain in the country permanently. In the cases of youth under 18 years of age, the chance of successfully winning immigration protection is high, in part because they are often seen as refugees or asylum-seekers in the eyes of the court.</p>

        <p>If it is successfully demonstrated that they left their country due to fleeing violence or a legitimate threat on the basis of their race, religion, nationality or political affiliation in their country of origin, these youth can apply for asylum and stay. Many of these kids are also eligible for a Special Immigrant Juvenile Status, commonly known as SIJS, if they are under 21 years old and were abused, neglected or abandoned by one or both parents.</p>

        <p>The Kojacs arrived in the US at the same time that there was a reported sharp increase in asylum applications from Albanians between 2014 and 2015. According to the Migration Policy Institute, poverty and unemployment has caused more than a third of the population to leave Albania over the last 25 years. As of 2014, the growing employment rate reached 17.9 percent and youth unemployment was nearly 32.5 percent.</p>

        <p>But none of this can be proven in court until the cases are seen before an immigration judge.</p>

    <section>
        <p>Therefore the bottleneck of cases in courts that deal with immigration issues is so worrisome for Matilda and others with similar situations, since the combination of an increase in crossings of unaccompanied minors and an a backlogged immigration system, has created a perfect recipe for heightened uncertainty that weights on these young girls and boy.</p>

<!--         <p>“Yo tengo casos que se han programado para el 2019, 2020 lo cual es ridículo y muy ineficiente, pero puedo entender el querer darle tiempo a cada persona para que establezcan su caso y puedan hablar sobres sus circunstancias particulares, y ver si se alinean con la ley o si hay otras razones por las cuales ellos merecen permanecer en este país”, explicó Ziesmer.</p>
 -->
        <p>According to  TRAC (Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse ) Immigration, this backlog goes back to the attempt by the Justice Department during 2014 to accommodate the approximately 60,000 cases of unaccompanied minors and families facing deportation orders, even though the are considered high priority cases. The TRAC study points out that New York is one of the most impacted cities with these cases because many of the judged handling these cases are located in the state.</p>

        <p>For some lawyers, the delayed hearings may be detrimental in cases where evidences can become obsolete- if witnesses or parents are unavailable during the court appointment or if the minor in question reaches 18 years of age during the process of waiting out their case.</p>

        <p>These delays in court have become more alarming now due to one of the executive orders signed by President Trump during the early weeks of his presidency. </p>

        <p>Signed on January 25th, an executive order that was aimed at improving public safety in the interior of the United States directly affected immigrant communities by criminalizing those who are in violation with immigration laws.</p>

        <p>Consequently, the current governmental administration looks to accelerate their efforts to deport anyone who doesn’t have legal authorization to stay in the country.</p>

    <blockquote class="quote-2">““One of my biggest fears is to be sent back to my country”, said Kocaj. “I’m here getting and education. I’m going to be a businesswoman and I will continue to give to this country.”
</blockquote>

        <p>This presents a problem for those awaiting their day in court. As they still haven’t been seen before an immigration judge, this kids don’t have protection against being deported during the wait for their hearing in immigration court.</p>
 
        <p>So the future of these kids depends on who shows up in their live first, an immigration judge or ICE agents.</p>

<!--         <p>“Uno de mis miedos más grandes es que me devuelvan al país donde yo nací”, dijo Kocaj. “Yo estoy aquí recibiendo una educación. Yo me convertiré en una mujer de negocios y continuaré aportando a este país”.</p>
 -->
        <p>Trump’s rhetoric and executive orders continue to criminalize the act of crossing the the border and speak in monolithic forms about people who make the trek northward, without recognizing the particular circumstances of each immigrant- especially kids- according to Brendan Davis, legal services coordinator at South Bronx United.</p>

<!--         <p>“Esta retórica que criminaliza el concepto de cruzar una línea divisora, no es totalmente correcta”, indicó Davis. “Hay que reconocer el concepto de solicitud de asilo. En realidad, los menores están ejerciendo su derecho de poder hacer eso [buscar asilo] cuando están huyendo de sus países”.</p> 
 -->
        <p>According to Davis, the fact that current immigration laws in the U.S. don’t recognize the totality of international laws that could give protection to many of these kids, as asylum seekers or refugees, has been lost during the recent conversations revolving around immigration-related actions by the president.</p>

        <p>When the Kocaj siblings had the bravery to take up the journey that took them nearly a month- passing through five country, traveling from one hemisphere to the other, by trucks, planes and other means of transportation that are difficult to identify- the last thing that they were imagining at the time was that they would later face a series of contradictions that get in the way of normalizing their immigration status in the US.</p>

        <blockquote class="quote-2">“Esta retórica que criminaliza el concepto de cruzar una línea divisora, no es totalmente correcta”, indicó Brendan Davis.</blockquote>

        <p>But for Matilda Kocaj, being reunited with her parents and the opportunity to be successful in life were the driving reasons that motivated her to make the journey to New York to be reunited with her family in a new home. </p>

<!--         <p>“Todos estábamos sorprendidos de lo mucho que habíamos cambiado. Cuando vi a mi mamá lo primero que le dije fue ‘Ay Dios mío, por qué te ves tan vieja’, y ella comenzó a reírse y a llorar al mismo tiempo”.</p>
 -->
        <p>Today Matilda Kocaj is realizing her dreams in New York, where she plays soccer on a girl’s team at South Bronx United and received a full scholarship from the Posse Foundation to attend Babson College in Boston, Massachusetts to study business and management, with the goal of starting her own nonprofit organization dedicated to helping child immigrants like her and her brother.</p>

<!--         <p>“Solo me siento bendecida por estar aquí. Me siento bendecida alrededor de las personas del South Bronx United y algún día espero poder darle lo mismo a otra persona”, dijo Kocaj.</p>
 -->
        <p>Many kids, like Matilda Kocaj, have succeeded in obtaining a new life in New York and reaching their goals despite the persistent background noise that is pervasive in their lives: a sort of time bomb shaped by one of Trump’s executive orders and an immigration court system that has delayed the possibilities to settle their immigration case in a timely manner.</p>
